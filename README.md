# PURRDATA-PS3-Joystk-MIDI-Pbend-Mod
this purrdata patch maps both joysticks on a PS3 USB controller to pitchbend and mod CC#1

i had some issues with the [bendin] and [bendout] objects so this patch constructs the MIDI code and outputs to [midiout]. the mod wheel uses the regular [ctlout] object. 

Cheers!
